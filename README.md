# Machine Learning
This repository contains all my projects for my machine learning class at Drake University, Fall 2016. Each project has its own explanation of the way I did things.

## Running the Source Code
1. Clone the repository

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/maheshgaya/machine-learning.git
  $ cd machine-learning
  ```
  
2. Open the source code ".ipynb" in Python Jupyter notebook
3. Run the source code cell by cell

**(Note: Some of the cells can take longer to execute because of the number of 
loops that they go through)**
